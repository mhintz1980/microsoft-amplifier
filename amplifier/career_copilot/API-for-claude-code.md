> Methods for Using the GLM Coding Plan in Claude Code

Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows -- all through natural language commands.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is even more powerful with the [GLM Coding Plan](https://z.ai/subscribe?utm_source=zai\&utm_medium=link\&utm_term=devpack-integration\&utm_campaign=Platform_Ops&_channel_track_key=w3mNdY8g)— giving you 3× the usage at a fraction of the cost. Code faster, debug smarter, and manage workflows seamlessly with more tokens, and rock-solid reliability.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  For users who have used the service before 2025-09-30: \
  The default model for GLM Coding Plan has been upgraded to GLM-4.6 with seamless user experience.\
  However, if you previously configured fixed model mappings for GLM-4.5 in `settings.json`, please refer to the "How to Switch the Model in Use" section in the FAQ below to make adjustments and ensure you're using the latest GLM-4.6 model.
</Warning>

## Step 1: Installing the Claude Code

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Recommended Installation Method">
    Prerequisites: [Node.js 18 or newer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

    ```
    # Install Claude Code
    npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

    # Navigate to your project
    cd your-awesome-project

    # Complete
    claude
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cursor Guided Installation Method">
    If you are not familiar with npm but have Cursor, you can enter the command in Cursor, and Cursor will guide you through the installation of Claude Code.

    ```bash  theme={null}
    https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview Help me install Claude Code
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  **Note**: If you encounter permission issues during installation, try using `sudo` (MacOS/Linux) or running the command prompt as an administrator (Windows) to re-execute the installation command.
</Note>

## Step 2: Config GLM Coding Plan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get API Key">
    * Access [Z.AI Open Platform](https://z.ai/model-api), Register or Login.
    * Create an API Key in the [API Keys](https://z.ai/manage-apikey/apikey-list) management page.
    * Copy your API Key for use.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment Variables">
    Set up environment variables using one of the following methods in the **macOS Linux** or **Windows**:

    <Tip>
      **Note**: Some commands show no output when setting environment variables — that’s normal as long as no errors appear.
    </Tip>

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="For first-time use in scripts (Mac/Linux)">
        Just run the following command in your terminal

        ```bash  theme={null}
        curl -O "https://cdn.bigmodel.cn/install/claude_code_zai_env.sh" && bash ./claude_code_zai_env.sh
        ```

        The script will automatically modify `~/.claude/settings.json` to configure the following environment variables

        ```json  theme={null}
        {
            "env": {
                "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your_zai_api_key",
                "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic",
                "API_TIMEOUT_MS": "3000000"
            }
        }
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Manual configuration (Windows MacOS Linux)">
        If you have previously configured environment variables for Claude Code, you can manually configure them as follows. A new window is required for the changes to take effect.

        <CodeGroup>
          ```bash MacOS & Linux theme={null}
          # Edit the Claude Code configuration file `~/.claude/settings.json`
          # Add or modify the env fields ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN
          # Note to replace `your_zai_api_key` with the API Key you obtained in the previous step

          {
              "env": {
                  "ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN": "your_zai_api_key",
                  "ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL": "https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic"
              }
          }
          ```

          ```cmd Windows Cmd theme={null}
          # Run the following commands in Cmd
          # Note to replace `your_zai_api_key` with the API Key you obtained in the previous step

          setx ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN your_zai_api_key
          setx ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic
          ```

          ```powershell Windows PowerShell theme={null}
          # Run the following commands in PowerShell
          # Note to replace `your_zai_api_key` with the API Key you obtained in the previous step

          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN', 'your_zai_api_key', 'User')
          [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL', 'https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic', 'User')
          ```
        </CodeGroup>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Start with Claude Code

Once the configuration is complete, you can start using **Claude Code** in your terminal or cmd:

```
cd your-project-directory
claude
```

> If prompted with "Do you want to use this API key," select "Yes."

After launching, grant Claude Code permission to access files in your folder as shown below:

## FAQ

### How to Switch the Model in Use

<Check>
  Mapping between Claude Code internal model environment variables and GLM models, with the default configuration as follows:

  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL`: `GLM-4.6`
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL`: `GLM-4.6`
  * `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL`: `GLM-4.5-Air`
</Check>

If adjustments are needed, you can directly modify the configuration file (for example, \~/.claude/settings.json in Claude Code) to switch to other models.

<Note>
  It is generally not recommended to manually adjust the model mapping, as hardcoding the model mapping makes it inconvenient to automatically update to the latest model when the GLM Coding Plan models are updated.
</Note>

<Note>
  If you want to use the latest default mappings (for existing users who have configured old model mappings), simply delete the model mapping configuration in `settings.json`, and Claude Code will automatically use the latest default models.
</Note>

1. Configure `~/.claude/settings.json` with the following content:

```text  theme={null}
{
  "env": {
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL": "glm-4.5-air",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL": "glm-4.6",
    "ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL": "glm-4.6"
  }
}
```

2. Open a new terminal window and run `claude` to start Claude Code, enter `/status` to check the current model status.

### Vision and Search MCP

Refer to the [Vision MCP Server](../mcp/vision-mcp-server) and [Search MCP Server](../mcp/search-mcp-server) documentation; once configured, you can use them in Claude Code.

### Manual Configuration Not Work

If you manually modified the `~/.claude/settings.json` configuration file but found the changes did not take effect, refer to the following troubleshooting steps.

* Close all Claude Code windows, open a new command-line window, and run `claude` again to start.
* If the issue persists, try deleting the `~/.claude/settings.json` file and then reconfigure the environment variables; Claude Code will automatically generate a new configuration file.
* Confirm that the JSON format of the configuration file is correct, check the variable names, and ensure there are no missing or extra commas; you can use an online JSON validator tool to check.

### Recommended Claude Code Version

We recommend using the latest version of Claude Code. You can check the current version and upgrade with the following commands:

> We have verified compatibility with Claude Code 2.0.14 and other versions.

```bash  theme={null}
# Check the current version
claude --version

2.0.14 (Claude Code)

# Upgrade to the latest
claude update
```
